Facial Recognition


How to use this program as of Version - 1.0.0:

Create a virtural env, then while in your virtural env,
Run requirements.txt first in the command line!


To Train:
After entering your virtural env, go to the directory where detector.py is,
add the pictures you want to train with in the "Training" folder,
then run the following command in the command prompt:

python detector.py --train -m="hog"

This may take a few minutes!

Your pictures will be encoded and sent into the "Output" folder, titled as "encodings.pkl"
This will be used to validate and test images. 

Note:
Anytime you add or remove pictures, run this command!


To Validate:
After entering your virtural env, go to the directory where detector.py is,
add the pictures you want to validate with in the "Validation" folder,
then run the following command in the command prompt:

python detector.py --validate

Note:
This will open each image in there and will take some time!

To Test:
After entering your virtural env, go to the directory where detector.py is,
find the path to picture you want to test,
then run the following command in the command prompt:

python detector.py --test -f picture.jpg

Note: 
Make sure its a jpg file and that the file is where the path points to!
